# CS 246: Web Information Systems

## Project 1
In this homework, I use Elasticsearch, a popular open-source text search engine, to index a Wikipedia dataset and to enable keyword searches on the dataset. I also apply various text transformations to the dataset and observe the effect of the transformations in search results.

## Project 2
In this project, I understand the use of ranking functions (also called Similarity Functions) in Elasticsearch to sort documents that match a certain query according to their relevance.

## Project 3
Many users find that a spell checker is a tool that they cannot live without; they mostly know how to spell, but once in a while they experience a time when the correct spelling simply slips their mind. With the help of a spell checker, the search engine tries to guess the user's intention and recommends what is likely to be the correct spelling of whatever the user typed. In this project, I learn the basic theory behind how spell checker works and explore different ways of implementing a basic spell checker.

## Project 4
The primary goal of this project is to learn how to use common software tools to run two important theoretical methods that I learned in the class: (1) low-rank matrix approximation and (2) latent dirichlet analysis. In Task 1, I learn how to perform a rank-k approximation of a matrix using Python. In Task 2, I learn how to perform LDA using MALLET.
